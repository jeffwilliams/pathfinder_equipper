Packaging Application for Heroku
--------------------------------

1. Created a Gemfile so that bundler knows what the app needs. The Gemfile 
   lists the gems the application depends on. After this the application
   can be run locally using:
  
    bundle install 
    bundle exec ruby server.rb

2. Created Procfile, used by heroku to start the app.
